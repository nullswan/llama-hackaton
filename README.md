# Nomi

Nowadays, people lose a lot of time trying to make the computer understand what they want to achieve.

So we created Nomi.
Nomi is an AI assistant that enables people to chat with their computer using natural language and get Nomi to execute actions for them. It gets user input, generates code from it, and then executes the newly generated code on the computer. This way, we created an assistant that can help with daily computer use.

It can open any application, launch websites, manage system settings, or interact with other software.
We are targeting companies with more than 500 employees that want to improve productivity at work.

What we are selling is a ChatGPT-like product plus the executable component on the computer.
The unique feature is natural-language-to-action.
The benefit of using Nomi is a drastic reduction in the time spent on time-consuming actions people perform every day on their personal computers.

We believe this will become the new norm and simplify people’s lives, as it’s already simplifying ours.<br />

Thank you for supporting,<br />

### 🤔 Why Nomi?

In a world where data ownership is challenging and AI is changing how we communicate, Nomi acts as a bridge between your private data and AI capabilities. It supports local provider.

While external providers involve sending data externally, Nomi works with local providers like Ollama, ensuring you retain control over your data. Our aim is to democratize AI by making it more accessible and user-friendly for everyone.

**Looking Ahead**

We're building the Nomi runtime quickly, but our journey doesn't stop there. Soon, we'll expand Nomi into a full AI platform designed to bridge the gap for non-technical users. Our goal is to make advanced AI accessible and easy to use for everyone, enabling you to benefit from AI without the need for technical expertise.
